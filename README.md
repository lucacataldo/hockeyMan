[StickStats Hockey Stats](https://stickstats.club) is an interactive web application that aggregates, processes, and displays NHL statistics in a meaningful way. Currently team stat views have been fully implemented, with player stats coming soon (check out [stickstats.club/beta](https://stickstats.club/beta) to view nightly changes)

The goal is to make advanced hockey stats accessible to new and diehard hockey fans alike. Currently all data is pulled from the NHL API (shout-out to @dword4 for documenting it) however other sources may be integrated in the future to allow for better stat coverage and detail.
