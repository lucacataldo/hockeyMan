# StickStats
StickStats is a serverless NHL stats explorer built using Vue. We currently use live regular season data provided by the public NHL API to give dynamic ratings to each of the teams. In the future, we will expand to include regular season / playoff stat splitting and improve our rating model, in addition to providing player stats & ratings. 



## Setup
To set up the project for development purposes: 
1. Clone the repository
2. `cd src/frontend`
3. `npm i`
4. `npm run serve`
5. follow directions from the vue cli
